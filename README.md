# LaserGRBL
Laser optimized GUI for [GRBL](https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki)

This is a modified version of LaserGRBL to incorporate Horizontal, Vertical and 45 Degree rasters. Currently Horizontal and Vertical are working. 45 Degree is a work in progress. I will also be optimizing the tool path to eliminate moves over white space at the start and end of scan lines. All of this I have written in a python script a year ago and will need to rewrite it.

LaserGRBL is a Windows GUI for [GRBL](https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki). Unlike other GUI LaserGRBL it is specifically developed for use with laser cutter and engraver.
LaserGRBL is compatible with [Grbl v0.9](https://github.com/grbl/grbl/) and [Grbl v1.1](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/)

### Suggested GCODE Generator

We suggest to use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to draw your vector files and vectorize bitmap.

Inkscape has two interesting GCODE plugin:
- [Raster 2 Laser GCode generator](https://github.com/305engineering/Inkscape) for raster engraving
- [J Tech Photonics Laser Tool](https://jtechphotonics.com/?page_id=2012) for vector engraving/cutting

More suggestion about GCODE Inkscape extension can be found searching on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=inkscape+laser)

### Compiling

LaserGRBL is written in C# for .NET Framework 4.0 and can be compiled with [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/) and of course with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) IDE/Compiler
